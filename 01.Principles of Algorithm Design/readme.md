 An algorithm is a
sequential set of instructions to execute a particular task. They are very important, as we
can break a complex problem into a smaller one to prepare simple steps to execute a big
problemâ€”that is the most important part of algorithms. A good algorithm is key for an
efficient program to solve a specific problem. The study of algorithms is also important
because it trains us to think very specifically about certain problems. It can help to increase
our problem-solving abilities by isolating the components of a problem and defining
relationships between these components.


# Algorithm design paradigms
In general, we can discern three broad approaches to algorithm design. They are:
 - Divide and conquer
 - Greedy algorithms
 - Dynamic programming
